Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of WÃ¼rttemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879. When he was 17, he moved to Switzerland, where he began his theoretical physics studies at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. He published his first paper in 1900, at the age of 21.
